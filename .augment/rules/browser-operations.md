# Browser Operations Rules

Guidelines for browser-related operations and limitations when working with web applications.

## Browser Interaction Limitations

- **No Browser Control**: AI agents cannot interact with, control, or read content from web browsers
- **No Browser Testing**: Cannot perform manual testing, click buttons, fill forms, or verify UI elements in actual browsers
- **No Browser Logs**: Cannot access browser console logs, network requests, or developer tools
- **No Visual Verification**: Cannot see or verify the visual appearance of web applications in browsers

## Alternative Testing Approaches

- **Unit Tests**: Use comprehensive unit tests to verify functionality instead of manual browser testing
- **Integration Tests**: Write integration tests that simulate user interactions programmatically
- **Component Tests**: Test React components in isolation using testing libraries like React Testing Library
- **Automated Testing**: Rely on automated test suites rather than manual browser verification

## Development Server Usage

- **Limited Utility**: Launching development servers (`npm run dev`) has limited utility since browser interaction is not possible
- **Avoid Unnecessary Launches**: Do not launch development servers unless specifically requested by the user
- **Focus on Code Quality**: Ensure code quality through testing and code review rather than manual browser verification
- **User Verification**: Let users perform manual browser testing and provide feedback on functionality

## When to Launch Development Servers

- **User Request**: Only when explicitly requested by the user for their own testing
- **Debugging Assistance**: When helping users debug issues that require a running server
- **Setup Verification**: When verifying that the development environment is properly configured

## Best Practices

- **Test-Driven Development**: Write comprehensive tests that cover all functionality
- **Code Review**: Focus on code quality and adherence to requirements
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation for users to test functionality themselves
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and validation in code rather than relying on browser testing
