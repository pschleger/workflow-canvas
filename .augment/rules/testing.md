# Testing Rules

**Rule Type**: Always  
**Description**: Comprehensive testing standards and practices that must be followed for all code changes, bug fixes, and feature implementations.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**: Follow the TDD cycle for all new features and improvements:
  1. **Red**: Write a failing test that defines the desired function or improvement
  2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
  3. **Refactor**: Improve code design while keeping tests green
  4. **Repeat**: Continue the cycle for each new feature or bugfix

- **Test-First Approach**: Write tests before writing implementation code
- **Minimal Implementation**: Only write enough code to make the failing test pass
- **Continuous Refactoring**: Refactor code continuously while ensuring tests still pass

## Bug Fixing and Reproduction

- **Reproducer Tests Required**: When fixing bugs, write a test that reproduces the bug first
- **Bug Fix Validation**: The reproducer test must succeed when the bug is fixed
- **Pre-Fix Testing**: Bug fixing should be preceded by a reproducer test if one does not yet exist
- **Regression Prevention**: Ensure bug fix tests prevent future regressions

## Test Coverage and Quality Standards

- **Mandatory Coverage**: Tests MUST cover all functionality being implemented
- **No Exceptions Policy**: Under no circumstances should any test type be marked as "not applicable"
- **Required Test Types**: Every project MUST have:
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests  
  - End-to-end tests
- **Authorization Override**: Only skip tests if human explicitly states: "I AUTHORIZE YOU TO SKIP WRITING TESTS THIS TIME"

## Test Design Principles

- **Robustness**: Design tests for robustness and avoid writing fragile tests
- **Clarity**: Tests should be clear and easy to understand
- **Quality Standards**: Apply the same quality standards to test code as production code
- **Avoid Code Bloat**: Keep test code clean and avoid unnecessary complexity
- **Maintainability**: Write tests that are easy to maintain and update

## Test Output and Validation

- **Pristine Output Required**: Test output MUST be pristine to pass - no ignored warnings or errors
- **Critical Information**: NEVER ignore system output or test logs - they often contain CRITICAL information
- **Error Testing**: If logs are supposed to contain errors, capture and test them explicitly
- **Output Validation**: Validate all expected outputs, including error conditions and edge cases

## Test Execution and Monitoring

- **Confirmation Testing**: Always run tests to confirm they fail as expected before implementation
- **Success Validation**: Run tests after implementation to confirm success
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitor test results and address any failures immediately
- **Log Analysis**: Analyze test logs and system messages for insights and potential issues
