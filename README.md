## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.19.0 or higher
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd statemachine-ui
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage Guide

### Creating Workflows

1. **Select an Entity**: Choose an entity from the sidebar to view its workflows
2. **Select a Workflow**: Click on a workflow to load it in the canvas
3. **Add States**: Double-click on the canvas to create new states
4. **Connect States**: Drag from state handles to create transitions
5. **Edit Properties**: Click the edit icon on states/transitions to modify them

### State Properties

- **Name**: Display name of the state
- **Description**: Optional description
- **Type**: Mark as initial state, final state, or regular state
- **Properties**: Custom JSON properties for additional metadata

### Transition Properties

- **Name**: Display name of the transition
- **Description**: Optional description
- **Conditions**: Rules that must be met for the transition to fire
- **Actions**: Operations to perform when the transition occurs

### Import/Export

- **Export**: Click the Export button to download the current workflow as JSON
- **Import**: Click the Import button to upload and load a workflow JSON file

## API Integration

The application uses a mock API service that simulates backend calls:

- `GET /api/entities` - Retrieve all entities
- `GET /api/workflow/{entity}` - Get workflows for an entity
- `GET /api/workflow/{entity}/{workflowId}` - Get specific workflow
- `PUT /api/workflow/{entity}` - Update workflow

### Replacing the Mock Backend

To integrate with a real backend:

1. Update `src/services/mockApi.ts` or create a new service
2. Implement the same interface with real HTTP calls
3. Update the service import in `src/App.tsx`
